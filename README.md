# open_source_rock_opera
In which I attempt to create an open-sourced rock-opera.

Github should only be used for text versions of things: lyrics, structure, notes, etc...

##TASKS (in no particular order):

- Develop plot and lyrics

- Find a suitable format for music to be placed here. (Some XML based format, maybe?)

- Write the music.

- Develop conventions for how to store music off github.

- Record and mix everything.
